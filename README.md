# VSD-Project
VSD Project is a virtual streaming deck (VSD) that can be use with keybind on your keyboard to simulate the famous elgato streamdeck but without paying it.

You can put custom name on every button to open app play some music, mute your micrphone, turn off your camera etc.

evrything will be custumisable on this software and everything is made with swinger and no other library

(EasySwing is imported in it but I made this library and i will post it on GitHub when it will be finished)


VSD Project is still in development
